# battery-notification
## _This is a simple battery notification_

I used this script for arch+i3

When the battery is approaching a critical value, the script plays a video (I used a video with spider sense)

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FirsMak/console-stopwatch.git
cd console-stopwatch/
sudo cp stopwatch /usr/bin/
```
